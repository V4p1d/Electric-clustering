# Electric-clustering
This is just a paper published by me where I use a series of clustering techniques on a series of features 
extracted from a dataset.

Abstract 
In this paper clustering algorithms are used to compare the daily load profiles of different European 
countries in different days of the week. The results of different algorithms, such as Fuzzy c-Means, Spectral 
Clustering and Expectation Maximization, applied to a classical compression method like Principal Component Analysis 
and ad hoc features for the problem at hand, are compared: the aim is to distinguish weekdays, holidays and 
preholidays in all the examined countries. In particular the results show that a single feature called Morning Slope, 
which solves the aforementioned task, despite the relevant differences among the several compared countries, outperforms 
the other considered features. This parameter can be interpreted as a classifying element with a direct physical meaning 
and interpretation, useful to obtain insights on the structure of the daily load profiles.
